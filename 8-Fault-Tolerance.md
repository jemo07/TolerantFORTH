# Fault Tolerance 

Fault Tolerance in the TolerantFORTH project aims to address and mitigate process failures and system errors, ensuring the system remains resilient and continues to operate reliably. By implementing fault tolerance mechanisms, TolerantFORTH aims to enhance system stability, minimize downtime, and provide mechanisms for automatic recovery.

In context, fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue operating and providing services in the presence of faults, errors, or failures. It involves designing the system to anticipate and recover from potential failures, ensuring the system remains functional and reliable.

What TolerantFORTH is trying to solve: The TolerantFORTH project recognizes the importance of fault tolerance in ensuring the robustness and availability of the system. By implementing fault tolerance mechanisms similar to those found in the BEAM VM, TolerantFORTH aims to address potential process failures, errors, and exceptions. The project seeks to provide features such as process linking and monitoring, allowing for supervision and automatic restarts in case of failures.

The objective is to build a resilient and fault-tolerant Forth system that can handle failures gracefully, recover from errors, and continue providing reliable services. By incorporating fault tolerance into the TolerantFORTH project, it aims to minimize system disruptions, improve system availability, and enhance the overall reliability of the system.

### Design Specs: 

**Fault Tolerance Mechanisms:** The FORTH system can implement fault tolerance mechanisms to handle process failures. Two common mechanisms are process linking and process monitoring.

**Process Linking:** Processes can be linked together, forming a supervision tree. When a process terminates abnormally, all linked processes receive a termination signal. This allows for proactive handling of process failures.

**Process Monitoring:** Processes can be monitored by other processes. A monitoring process is notified when a monitored process terminates abnormally. The monitoring process can then take appropriate actions, such as restarting the failed process.

**Supervision and Restart:** With process linking and monitoring, a supervisor process can be responsible for overseeing and managing other processes. The supervisor can monitor child processes and automatically restart them if they fail.

**Error Handling:** When a process encounters an error or exception, it can handle the error locally or propagate it up the supervision tree. Error handling can include logging, retrying, restarting, or escalating the error to higher-level processes.

### Example Implementation:

Here's an example implementation of fault tolerance mechanisms in the FORTH system:

```forth
\ Process Data Structure
: process ( -- addr ) here ;

\ Process Creation
: create-process ( -- pid ) process allocate throw ;

\ Process Linking
: link-processes ( pid1 pid2 -- )
  \ Link two processes together
  throw ;

\ Process Monitoring
: monitor-process ( pid monitor-pid -- )
  \ Monitor a process with another process
  throw ;

\ Process Termination
: terminate-process ( pid -- )
  \ Terminate a process and clean up resources
  throw ;

\ Supervisor Process
: supervisor ( -- )
  \ Supervisor process code
  begin
    0 \ Dummy implementation
  again ;

\ Example usage
create-process constant pid1
create-process constant pid2

pid1 pid2 link-processes \ Link pid1 and pid2

supervisor pid1 \ Assign supervisor process for pid1
monitor-process pid2 pid1 \ Monitor pid2 with pid1

\ Main loop
: main-loop
  begin
    \ Process execution code

    \ Check for process termination or failure
    \ Handle termination signals and take appropriate actions

  again ;

main-loop
```
In this example, the Forth sytems attemps to build on the BEAM VM functionality and builds faul tolrance with the following components: 

- The `process` word defines the process data structure.

- The `create-process` word creates a new process and returns its process identifier (PID).

- The `link-processes` word links two processes together, enabling them to receive termination signals when either of them terminates abnormally.

- The `monitor-process` word monitors a process with another process. When the monitored process terminates abnormally, the monitoring process receives a signal and can take appropriate actions.

- The `terminate-process` word terminates a process and cleans up its resources.

- The `supervisor` word represents a supervisor process that oversees other processes. The supervisor can handle termination signals and take appropriate actions, such as restarting failed processes.

- The example shows two processes, `pid1` and `pid2`, being linked together and monitored by the supervisor process. This allows for supervision and automatic restarts in case of process failures.


Fault tolerance is crucial in various domains, especially in critical systems where downtime or failures can have significant consequences. By providing fault tolerance mechanisms, TolerantFORTH aims to create a robust and reliable Forth implementation suitable for use cases that require high availability, resilience, and automatic recovery.
