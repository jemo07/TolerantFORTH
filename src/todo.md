Overview of Building TolerantForth:


### Tasks to Do:

- Implement lightweight processes: Define the data structure for processes, including the execution context and process-specific temporary stack. Develop mechanisms for creating, scheduling, and managing lightweight processes.

- Implement process management: Create a process management system responsible for process creation, termination, and context switching. Maintain a process queue and ensure fair execution and resource allocation.

- Implement the inner interpreter: Develop the inner interpreter that executes FORTH words within the context of a process. Maintain separate execution contexts for each process, including the process-specific temporary stack. Enable fetching and execution of words.

- Implement tagged stacks: Introduce tagged stacks to enable communication and messaging between processes. Each process should have its own temporary stack for local data manipulation. Develop a global stack with tagged elements as a communication channel between processes.

- Implement the messaging mechanism: Provide words to push data onto the global tagged stack with a specific tag (send) and read/consume data from the global stack based on the tag (receive). Enable processes to communicate and exchange information.

- Implement scheduling and preemption: Develop a cooperative multitasking approach for process scheduling. Allocate a certain number of FORTH word executions to each process before yielding control back to the scheduler. Select the next process to execute based on a predefined scheduling algorithm.

- Implement process isolation: Ensure processes are isolated from each other to prevent interference and ensure data integrity. Each process should have its own execution context, including local stacks and variables. Data shared between processes should be explicitly communicated through the global tagged stack.

- Implement fault tolerance mechanisms: Provide mechanisms for process linking and monitoring to enable supervision and automatic restarts in case of failures. Implement termination signals and appropriate actions for recovery or restarting failed processes.
