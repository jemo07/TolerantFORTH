# Tagged Stacks

In the TolerantFORTH project, tagged stacks play a crucial role in enabling communication and messaging between lightweight processes. Here's a summary of the implementation and significance of tagged stacks in the TolerantFORTH system:

- Implementation: The TolerantFORTH system incorporates tagged stacks by introducing a global stack that serves as a communication channel between processes. Each process also has its own temporary stack for local data manipulation.

- Communication Mechanism: Tagged stacks provide a means for processes to exchange messages and share data. Processes can push data onto the global stack along with a specific tag using a designated FORTH word (e.g., `send`). The tag serves as a identifier or label to differentiate and route messages to the intended recipient processes.

- Message Reception: To receive messages, processes can use another designated FORTH word (e.g., `receive`). This word reads and consumes data from the global stack based on a specified tag. It allows processes to retrieve and process messages intended for them.

- Controlled Data Sharing: Tagged stacks facilitate controlled data sharing between processes. By explicitly tagging data pushed onto the global stack, the system ensures that shared data is explicitly communicated and prevents unintended interference or modification by unauthorized processes.

- Interprocess Communication: Tagged stacks provide a lightweight and efficient mechanism for interprocess communication within the TolerantFORTH system. Processes can exchange messages, share information, and coordinate their actions using the global stack, enhancing collaboration and enabling concurrent execution.

- Flexibility and Customization: The implementation of tagged stacks in TolerantFORTH allows for customization and flexibility. The specific tagging scheme and communication protocols can be tailored to the requirements of the application or system, providing a versatile means of interprocess communication.

In summary, tagged stacks in the TolerantFORTH project provide a powerful communication mechanism between lightweight processes. They enable processes to exchange messages, share data, and collaborate effectively while maintaining process isolation and data integrity. Tagged stacks play a vital role in facilitating concurrent execution and communication within the TolerantFORTH system.

### Breakdown of Specs:

**Process-Specific Temporary Stacks:** Each process in the FORTH system would have its own temporary stack for local data manipulation. These stacks would be isolated and specific to each process, allowing for independent execution and data storage.

**Global Stack with Tags:** The FORTH system would include a global stack that acts as a communication channel between processes. This global stack would be shared among all processes and would hold tagged elements to facilitate messaging and communication.

**Tagging Mechanism:** Each element pushed onto the global stack would be associated with a tag. The tag can be an identifier or a specific value that represents the intended recipient process or a particular communication context. The tag provides a way to differentiate messages and route them to the appropriate recipient processes.

**Sending Messages:** To send a message, a process can push the message data onto the global stack along with a corresponding tag. For example, a FORTH word (e.g., `send`) can be defined to take the message and tag as inputs and push them onto the global stack.

**Receiving Messages:** To receive a message, a process can check the global stack for elements with matching tags. It can retrieve and process the messages accordingly. For example, a FORTH word (e.g., `receive`) can be defined to read and consume messages from the global stack based on a specified tag.

**Synchronization and Coordination:** The FORTH system can include synchronization and coordination mechanisms to ensure proper message handling. For example, it can provide primitives such as semaphores or mutexes to coordinate access to the global stack and prevent race conditions when multiple processes try to send or receive messages simultaneously.

### Example Implementation:

Here's an example implementation of tagged stacks in the FORTH system for inter-process communication:

```forth
variable global-stack \ Global stack for inter-process communication

\ Push an element with a tag onto the global stack
: push-tagged ( element tag -- )
  over swap \ swap element and tag
  global-stack @ over ! \ push tag
  global-stack @ 1+ ! \ increment stack pointer
  global-stack @ ! \ push element ;

\ Pop the top element from the global stack
: pop ( -- element )
  global-stack @ 1- ! \ decrement stack pointer
  global-stack @ \ fetch element
  global-stack @ swap ! \ remove element from the stack ;

\ Send a message by pushing it onto the global stack with a tag
: send ( element tag -- ) push-tagged ;

\ Receive a message with a specific tag from the global stack
: receive ( tag -- element )
  begin
    pop swap \ pop element, compare tag
    dup = 0= until \ continue until a matching tag is found
    nip \ remove tag from the stack
  ;

\ Example usage
: process1 ( -- )
  10 process2-tag send \ Send a message to process2
  ." Process 1 sent a message." cr ;

: process2 ( -- )
  process2-tag receive \ Receive a message with process2-tag
  ." Process 2 received a message." cr ;

\ Initialize global stack
create 100 cells global-stack !

\ Example execution
process1 process2

\ Main loop
: main-loop
  process1
  process2
again ;

main-loop
```

The FORTH system would implement tagged stacks for inter-process communication. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

- The `push-tagged` word takes an element and a tag as inputs and pushes them onto the global stack. The tag is stored

 before the element to associate it with the pushed value.

- The `pop` word retrieves and removes the top element from the global stack.

- The `send` word sends a message by pushing an element with a corresponding tag onto the global stack.

- The `receive` word receives a message by retrieving the element from the global stack that matches the specified tag.

- The example shows two processes, `process1` and `process2`, where `process1` sends a message with the tag `process2-tag`, and `process2` receives the message with the matching tag.

- The global stack is initialized with 100 cells to serve as the shared stack for inter-process communication.

Note that this is a simplified example to illustrate the use of tagged stacks for messaging in the FORTH system. In practice, additional error handling, synchronization mechanisms, and more complex messaging protocols can be incorporated as needed.
